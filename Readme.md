# Swift Functions Tutorial App 
This application shows a quick demo on the different ways we can call a function. 
* No Parameters and No Return
* 1 Paramenter and No Return
* Multiple Parameters and No Return
* 1 Parameter and a Return value.

It does leave out the no parameters and return but that should be easy enough to figure out. 

Inside the code there are lots of comments to help you see how this tutorial was made.
